simple composable unidirectional user interfaces using [pull streams](https://pull-stream.github.io)

```shell
npm install --save inu
```

## why?

explained best by [`jarvisaoieong/redux-architecture`](https://github.com/jarvisaoieong/redux-architecture),

> In classical [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), which side effect is handled by thunk middleware, is not [fractal](http://staltz.com/unidirectional-user-interface-architectures.html) (a term that is nicely explained by @stalz)

> ![](http://i.imgur.com/gRH1uvq.png)

> Even with some new Redux additions, like redux-saga, are also not composable in a fractal way with the rest of architecture.

> I think [elm architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/)
has found the proper way to do it right. Beside composing Views, State and Reducers (which are already composed in classical Redux), **Actions** and **Effects** should be composed too. All that leads to composition of application pieces at the higher level.

`inu`'s implementation is more or less a direct port of [`tom`](https://github.com/gcanti/tom) using [pull streams](https://pull-stream.github.io) instead of [rx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rx).

## example

```js
const { start, html, pull } = require('inu')
const delay = require('pull-delay')

const app = {

  init: () => ({
    model: 0,
    effect: 'SCHEDULE_TICK' // start perpetual motion
  }),

  update: (model, action) => {
    switch (action) {
      case 'TICK':
        return {
          model: model === 59 ? 0 : model + 1,
          effect: 'SCHEDULE_TICK'
        }
      default:
        return { model }
    }
  },

  view: (model, dispatch) => html`
    <div class='clock'>
      Seconds Elapsed: ${model}
    </div>
  `,

  run: (effect) => {
    switch (effect) {
      case 'SCHEDULE_TICK':
        return pull(
          pull.values(['TICK']),
          delay(1000)
        )
    }
  }
}

const main = document.querySelector('.main')
const { views } = start(app)

pull(
  views(),
  pull.drain(function (view) {
    html.update(main, view)
  })
)
```

for a full example of composing multiple apps together, see [source](./examples/index.js) and [demo](https://ahdinosaur.github.io/inu).

## usage

where *state* is an object with a required key `model` and an optional key `effect`,

an `inu` app is defined by an object with the following (optional) keys:

- `init`: a function returning the initial state
- `update`: a `update(model, action)` pure function, returns the new state
- `view`: a `view(model, dispatch)` pure function, returns the user interface declaration
- `run`: a `run(effect, actions)` function, returns an optional [pull source stream](https://pull-stream.github.io) of future actions

### `inu = require('inu')`

the top-level `inu` module is a grab bag of all `inu/*` modules.

you can also require each module separately like `require('inu/start')`.

### `streams = inu.start(app)`

streams is an object with the following keys:

- `actions`: a function that returns a [pull source stream](https://pull-stream.github.io) for actions
- `models`: a function that returns a [pull source stream](https://pull-stream.github.io) for models
- `views`: a function that returns a [pull source stream](https://pull-stream.github.io) for views
- `effects`: a function that returns a [pull source stream](https://pull-stream.github.io) for effects
- `effectActionStreams`: a function that returns a [pull source stream](https://pull-stream.github.io) for any streams of next actions caused by effects
